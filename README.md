# Tetris

### Notes:
##### The Driver.java file contains the driver class that runs the other classes and contains the main method.
##### Much like the original game, if the piece is unable to rotate due to its position relative to a side wall, rotation will be allowed by shifting the piece inwards.
##### The following are some images of the screen layouts and a demo video:

Note that there is an option to pause the game (this was not explored in the demo video).
Also note that the pop-up window asking for a name to record the score displays strangely on the demo video due to the constraints of the screen recording software. It normally displays as shown in the screen layout image.
